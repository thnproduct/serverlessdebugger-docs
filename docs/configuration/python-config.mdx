## Using Layers
Integrating Serverless Debugger using AWS Lambda Layers is the recommended (and easier) way to get started with Serverless Debugger. 
Depending on whether or not you choose to use a custom runtime, you can integrate Serverless Debugger with no code changes 
at all or just by wrapping your handler function.

### Step 1 - Deploy Your Function to AWS Lambda
Bundle all your Python module files and any additional required Python libraries, and then
upload it to the AWS Lambda console using the **Upload a.zip file** option for the code entry type.
Note that Thundra dependencies are not expected to be in the artifact to be uploaded, as they
come with a layer that will be utilized at a later point

### Step 2 - Add Thundra Layer
Next, add the Thundra layer by clicking on the Layers option in the Designer tab on your
Lambda function console. Then select the “Add Layer” button and add the Thundra layer's ARN.

```jsx
arn:aws:lambda:${region}:269863060030:layer:thundra-lambda-python-layer:${latest-version} 
```

:::note

Latest version of the Thundra Python layer  ![Thundra Python Layer](https://img.shields.io/endpoint.svg?url=https://thundra-layer-python-svd2fu4gtfa3.runkit.sh/) 

:::

:::info

Note that the region of the ARN is dynamic, so you need to change it accordingly to 
the region where you deploy your function. So let’s say that you deploy your Lambda
 function to the Oregon (us-west-2) region. The layer ARN 
 will be ```arn:aws:lambda:us-west-2:269863060030:layer:thundra-lambda-python-layer:${layer-version}```

### Step 3: Configure Handler
Set the handler to ```thundra.handler.wrapper```. Set the
```thundra_agent_lambda_handler``` environment variable value to your original handler
(e.g., handler.handle ).


### Step 4: Invoke Your Function

Clicking on the “Test” button, which is located on the top right side of the AWS console, will result
in an invocation of your function (after you have configured test data per the specifications of
your function)

After generating your first invocation, the “Next” button will appear in the Invocation Monitor bar.
Simply click the button to see monitoring data from your invocation.

## Without Layers

### Step 1:  Install Thundra’s python package

```jsx
pip3 install thundra -t .
```

### Step 2: Deploy Your Function to AWS Lambda.
Bundle all your Python module files and any additional required Python libraries, and then
upload it to the AWS Lambda console using the “Upload a.zip file” option for the code entry type.

### Step 3: Configure Handler
Set the handler to ```thundra.handler.wrapper```. Set the ```thundra_agent_lambda_handler```
environment variable value to your handler.

### Step 4: Invoke your function!
Clicking on the “Test” button, which is located on the top right side of the AWS console, will result
in an invocation of your function (after you have configured test data per the specifications of
your function).

Now you can try to invoke your Lambda function and see the details of your invocation in the
Thundra console!
