# Introduction

Start online debug sessions while the AWS Lambda functions run on AWS Cloud. 
ServerlessDebugger sets up an easy and secure connection between your AWS Lambda functions and 
your favorite [IDE](#getting-started). Debug your serverless applications natively with their own permissions. 
Stop mocking resources and simulating the environments! Put breakpoints and pause
the execution of the [NodeJS](/configuration/nodejs) and [Python](/configuration/python) functions to see the error, variables, stack trace and more!

## Getting started

import {PluginCard} from '@site/src/components/PluginCard';

<div class="cols-2">
  <PluginCard plugin="VS Code" languages="NodeJS, Python" target="/extensions/vs-code"></PluginCard>
</div>

### Don't stop the whole process, just debug one invocation at a time

Debug your serverless app like you debug any code that you host on your computer with native debugging actions,
 enabling you to see the values of local variables and the entire stack trace.

## Debug Lambdas on AWS with their own permissions
Remove the barriers that prevent the ability to debug Lambda functions on IDE.
